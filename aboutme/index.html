    <p>Greetings everyone! Allow me to introduce myself; as I told you
     my name is Maria Lilian, however, I go by the nickname of Lily, which you
     are welcome to use. I live in Huancayo Peru, aged 18. My passion lies
     in the field of technology, which I consider to be of utmost importance
     in our current society. Consequently, I am pursuing a degree in software
     development, as I enjoy the process of creating and innovating.
     Singing and dancing, especially to K-pop music, is a beloved hobby of mine.
     specializes in toys.I know English, French and currently studying Korean language.</p>

    <p>One of the aspects I greatly admire about BYU Idaho is the wealth 
     of knowledge that it imparts through its comprehensive reading materials, 
     coupled with its flexible approach to studying. As a lifelong member
     of the Church, I feel blessed and content with my spiritual journey thus far,
     as it has positively impacted not only me but also my family.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I am thankful for this opportunity and anticipate building strong friendships
     and exploring the fascinating realm of web design with all of you.</p>
